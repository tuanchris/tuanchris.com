This is a fork project of [Hydejack](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack) that I use to power my personal website. This project use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a simple site generator that allows you to create static website easily. You can write your content in your favorite markup language and Jekyll will help you generate html, CSS, and javascript for you. You can host the website on GitHub Pages for free and connect it to a custom domain.
