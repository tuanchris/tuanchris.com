I am a data-focused manager with a well-rounded skill set, focusing on data analytics, business intelligence and applied data science. My previous educations in physics and finance gave me a highly analytical and critical mindset when solving problems. My professional experiences revolve around mining data to create business value, often by coming up with my own projects and job descriptions.

I have experiences building teams of data-focused disciplines from scratch and currently am managing a team of nearly 20 people including data analysts, data engineers, and data scientists. Most of the projects I participated in require close collaboration with stakeholders to deliver measurable results that align with top management’s priorities and company’s value. I pay a lot of attention to details, learn extremely fast, and truly believe in the importance of data analytics and serverless computing.
