title: About
---
I am a senior data science manager with a well-rounded skill set, focusing on data analytics, business intelligence, and applied data science. With more than six years of experience, I am leading the data science department at Vietnam’s largest retail company. My previous education in physics and finance gave me a highly analytical and critical mindset when solving problems. My professional experiences revolve around mining data to create business value, often by coming up with my projects and job descriptions.

I have experience building teams of data-focused disciplines from scratch. I currently manage a group of nearly 20 people, including data analysts, data engineers, and data scientists. Most of the projects I participated in require close collaboration with stakeholders to deliver measurable results that align with top management’s priorities and the company’s value. I pay a lot of attention to detail and learn extremely fast. I truly believe that combining data science and serverless computing can bring tremendous benefits for societies and businesses.
